# Colour Converter - app for converting colours to hsl values

## Goal
My goal is really to try out Tailwind CSS.

I was looking for a document to style so I thought might as well do it on an app I will use.

## Why I'm making this app
The colours I find online are usually in hex or rgb format. I find it hard to modify the colours in these formats. Making a colour lighter, darker, saturated or desaturated is hard in hex or rgb format. These are easily done in hsl though so I wanted to make my own colour converter tool.
